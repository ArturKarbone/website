          <article>
            <p>Writing code is what we - developers, were taught to do. We proudly write clean code, apply eXtreme programming practices, refactor the mess, introduce new frameworks and learn new programming languages. We concentrate on technology so much that we completely forget that only 15% of our success is due to technical knowledge. </p>
            <p>There are at least 12 million developers on the market. Competition is very tough and will continue to grow. Distinguishing yourself from 12 millions by being “the strongest technical guy” is doomed to fail. There always will be someone who can make the work cheaper. And, given skilled talent availability, usually with a higher quality.</p>
            <p>Custom software development costs are unbelievably high. Forward-looking companies optimize costs by hiring skilled contractors for a task-work, outsourcing mundane, automating things out, leveraging machine learning and replace hand-made solutions with SaaS.</p>
            <p>The IT world has changed. And, like it or not, we have to question the status quo of what does it mean to be a great developer. </p>
            <p>The goal of this training is to help you - developer, become a distinguished developer, team lead, architect or whoever you want to be, by building skills that most competitors do not possess - <strong>soft skills.</strong></p>
            <p>This training will cover wide range of topics aimed to make you truly valuable asset in a modern organisation, including:</p>
            <h4>How to help your customers succeed via long and quick wins</h4>
            <h4>How to negotiate, make winning proposals and align people around your vision</h4>
            <h4>How to spark and drive the change via Lean Change Management</h4>
            <h4>How to make your workplace more fun and dynamic</h4>
            <h4>How to work effectively in a team</h4>
            <h4>How to make your team the best in the company</h4>
            <h4>How to find consensus in the team without being killed</h4>
            <h4>How to overcome resistance and skepticism from “seniors”</h4>
            <h4>How to move fast in demanding environments</h4>
            <h4>How to estimate work without shooting yourself in the leg</h4>
            <h4>How to decide in situations of high uncertainty and reduce it</h4>
            <h4>How to learn effectively</h4>
            <h4>… and much more!</h4>
